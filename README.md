A predictive model for sales forecasting using a comprehensive dataset containing various features related to sales transactions. 
Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values for key attributes. 
Utilized pivot tables and imputation techniques to ensure data completeness and accuracy. 
Enhanced the dataset by creating new features and transformed categorical features using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding. 
Implemented visualizations to understand distributions and outliers in the dataset. 
Applied transformations to address skewness and standardized numerical features to improve model performance.  
Developed and evaluated several regression models including Extra Trees Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, and LightGBM Regressor. 
Conducted cross-validation and assessed model performance using metrics like RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error. 
Optimized model performance through Randomized Search Cross-Validation for hyperparameter tuning on the LightGBM Regressor.
